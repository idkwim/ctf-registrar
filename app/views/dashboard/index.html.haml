          You're the registered owner of #{'TEAM NAME'} [#{'TAG'}].

          Give your teammates the tag (it's #{'TAG'}) and the team password you
          entered when you created the team. Don't give them your personal account
          password.

          As captain, you'll be the one picking questions, submitting answers,
          and hopefully not surrendering on too many questions.

          Team members will be able to read questions, but not be able to pick new
          questions, submit answers, or surrender on questions.

          You're a member of #{'TEAM NAME'} [#{'TAG'}].

          When the game starts, you'll be able to read questions, but you'll have
          to get the team captain to pick new questions, submit answers, and
          surrender on questions.
