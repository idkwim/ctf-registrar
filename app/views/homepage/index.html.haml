      # Welcome and OMG

      Are you excited? We are! It's time to register for the DEF CON CTF
      qualifiers! We're beside ourselves with excitement!

      You've undoubtedly read everything we've posted on
      [our main website](https://legitbs.net/), read every single thread about
      CTF in the
      [DEF CON forums](https://forum.defcon.org/forumdisplay.php?f=716), and
      of course you've been staying up to date with
      [@legitbs_ctf on Twitter](https://twitter.com/LegitBS_CTF), so
      let's cut to the chase:

      1. Create a new user or log in to a user you've already created below.
      2. Create or join a team after logging in.
      3. Wait until June 15.
